# My Portfolio Website : [Visit Here](https://sandycheng.netlify.app/)

### My portfolio site that includes links to my projects, social medias, and ways to get in contact with me

## How it's made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

I was focused on making a site that was tailored to my liking with my favorite color (blue) and a place to showcase some of my humor. 

## Optimizations
When I impove this project, I would add in a dark mode option for those that prefer a dark sites. I would like to add some gifs instead of a still photo under projects. 


## Lesson Learned:
Separation of concers. HTML, CSS, JS are separated in different folders. I learned different styling. The photo of myself took some time to find the right shape that I wanted.
